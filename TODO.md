HOWTO REPO ADVICE
* update the chad-guy's code for no more MD5s
* if there is another script that is better, go find that (search the forums?)
* look at the main repo and how its constructed

no better scripts out there that I can find.  Fork Chad's, and host myself.
Main repo uses some weird ancient script at github/xbmc
